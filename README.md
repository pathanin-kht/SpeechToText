# Speech-to-Text and Save

## Overview
This project allows users to convert speech into text and save the result in a `.txt` file. The user can choose between Thai and English for the speech recognition process. The project uses the `speech_recognition` library and Google's Speech Recognition API to convert the speech to text and saves it in a file for further use.

## Example
- The user speaks into the microphone, and the application converts the speech to text and displays the result.
- The text is saved to a file named `output_thai.txt` or `output_english.txt` depending on the language selected.
